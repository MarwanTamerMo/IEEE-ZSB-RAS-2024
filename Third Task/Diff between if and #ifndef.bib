// Using normal if-else statements provides conditional execution based on runtime conditions. This means that the code within the if or else blocks is evaluated and executed during program execution.

//? On the other hand, conditional compilation directives (#ifdef, #else, #endif) are processed by the preprocessor before compilation. They control whether certain sections of code are included or excluded from the final compiled program based on compile-time conditions. This means that the code within these directives is either included or excluded during the compilation process based on predefined macros or conditions.
